","Modèle logique métier - FR LM Prise en charge","Association du document à une prise en charge du patient/usager par un professionnel ou par une structure.
 - Exemples :
   - Dans une structure hospitalière, cette prise en charge est une hospitalisation complète ou partielle, des actes et soins externes, une consultation, etc.
   - Dans un cabinet, cette prise en charge est une consultation ou des actes et soins.
 - Pour un document d'expression personnelle du patient ou pour un document élaboré sans la présence du patient (ex : synthèse médicale) ou pour un document produit via un SNR, la prise en charge n'a pas de signification. Dans ce cas, on ne renseignera que les données obligatoires : date de prise en charge (avec nulllFlavor possible) et secteur d'activité.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"",""
